# Notices

Codex Skin Builder is an **unofficial** customization project and is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by OpenAI**.

## Software license

The MIT License in `LICENSE` applies to the **software source code** in this repository, including scripts, CSS, injectors, manifests, skill metadata, and documentation that describes the software.

It does **not** grant rights to:

- OpenAI or Codex trademarks, product names, logos, or trade dress.
- Official Codex or ChatGPT application binaries, `.app` bundles, or `app.asar`.
- User-supplied images or third-party artwork placed into a generated theme.
- Character likenesses, franchise artwork, celebrity imagery, or brand assets.
- The demonstration screenshots and character artwork included in this repository, except where the relevant rights holder separately grants permission.

## Demonstration assets

The screenshots under `assets/5741784165072_.pic_hd.jpg`, `assets/5751784165079_.pic_hd.jpg`, and `assets/5761784165354_.pic.jpg` demonstrate themes produced with this project. Their inclusion in the repository does not grant permission to reuse third-party characters, marks, or artwork that may appear in them.

The bundled runtime under `assets/reference-skin/` includes visual assets used to demonstrate the scaffold and reduced-motion fallback. Replace them with artwork you are authorized to use before distributing a branded or commercial theme.

## Runtime

This project does not redistribute Node.js. Runtime scripts use an available Node.js installation or the executable bundled with the user's official Codex desktop application when supported by the packaged workflow.

## Security model

Themes are applied through Chromium DevTools Protocol on **loopback only**. While a themed session is running, treat the local debugging port as sensitive: do not run untrusted local software that could attach to it. Use the restore script or launcher to tear down the themed session and debugging port.

## Acknowledgment

The README organization and notice structure were adapted from [Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin](https://github.com/Fei-Away/Codex-Dream-Skin), which is distributed under the MIT License.
